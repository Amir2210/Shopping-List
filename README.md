🎉 Welcome to the Shopping List App! 🛍️

This simple React application allows you to manage your shopping list with ease. Keep track of your items, mark them as completed, and remove them when you're done. Let's dive in!

📦 Tech Stack:
* React.js
* nanoid (for generating unique IDs)
* react-toastify (for displaying toast notifications)

👩🏽‍🍳 Features:
* Add Items: Easily add new items to your shopping list.
* Mark Completed: Toggle the status of items as completed or pending.
* Remove Items: Delete items from the list when they're no longer needed.
* Toast Notifications: Receive instant feedback with toast notifications for successful actions.

💭 Process:
I started by setting up the basic structure of the React application. The main components include:

* Form: Allows users to add new items to the shopping list.
* ShoppingListItems: Displays the list of items with options to mark as completed or remove.

I utilized React hooks, specifically useState, to manage the state of the shopping list items. Local storage is used to persist the data between sessions, ensuring that your list remains intact even after refreshing the page.

📚 Learnings:
* Reinforced understanding of React hooks and state management.
* Practiced integrating third-party libraries (nanoid and react-toastify) into React applications.
* Learned about using local storage for data persistence in web applications.

✨ Improvements:
While the current version of the app serves its purpose, there are always opportunities for enhancement:

* UI/UX Improvements: Enhance the visual design and user experience of the application.
* Edit Functionality: Implement the ability to edit item names or details.
* Categories or Sorting: Allow users to categorize items or sort them based on priority.
